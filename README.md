# MorseCodeTutor
A landing page for Dr. Jack Purdum, W8TEE's Morse Code Tutor

One day, not so long ago, Jack decided to share a little bit of magic with us.  I can only assume his hope was to shed a little love on the community.

Jack said have some software for something called a "blue pill" and wire it up thusly.  After a little elbow grease from his fellow tinkerers, we arrived at what you see before you.

This is by no means the Alpha-Omega MorseCodeTutor, but this and maybe some extra spares from your junk drawer will get you very close.  If you find it useful... or if you find any errors.  Please feel free to create a "pull request" with your changes.

If you're new to open source, drop me a line and I'll help out.
